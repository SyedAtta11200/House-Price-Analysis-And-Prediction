## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing house price data to identify key factors affecting pricing, detect outliers, and build a predictive model for future price forecasting. The goal is to gain insights into market trends and offer predictions for prospective home buyers and investors.

## Data Overview
The dataset consists of records with features such as house size, location, number of bedrooms, and historical sales prices.

## Data Cleaning and Exploration
- **Task Completed**: The data was cleaned by handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and identifying outliers.
- **Exploration**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using visualizations like scatter plots and box plots to understand relationships between house prices and features.

## Feature Engineering
- **Task Completed**: New features were created to enhance prediction accuracy, such as the age of the house and number of bedrooms per floor. Categorical features, like location, were encoded into numerical values.

## Outlier Analysis
- **Task Completed**: Outliers were identified in the dataset by comparing house prices with similar properties.
- **Investigation**: The reasons for these outliers were analyzed, and certain combinations of features contributing to extreme values were uncovered.

## Predictive Modeling
- **Task Completed**: Machine learning models, including linear regression and random forest, were trained to predict house prices based on various features.
- **Model Evaluation**: The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to determine their performance.

## Future Price Prediction
- **Task Completed**: The trained model was used to predict future house prices based on hypothetical scenarios. For example, predictions were made for houses with specific characteristics in different locations.

## Report and Recommendations
- **Task Completed**: A comprehensive report was prepared, summarizing the data exploration results, feature engineering techniques, outlier analysis, and model evaluation.
- **Recommendations**: The report provided recommendations for further analysis, such as collecting additional data on market trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for analysis and modeling)
